## Sample Data Setup

First, let's create some sample sales data:

```sql id="create_sales_table"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales;
CREATE TABLE sales AS
SELECT * FROM VALUES
  ('2024-01-01'::DATE, 'Product A', 'Electronics', 1200, 5),
  ('2024-01-01'::DATE, 'Product B', 'Clothing', 800, 12),
  ('2024-01-02'::DATE, 'Product A', 'Electronics', 1500, 7),
  ('2024-01-02'::DATE, 'Product C', 'Books', 300, 15),
  ('2024-01-03'::DATE, 'Product B', 'Clothing', 950, 8),
  ('2024-01-03'::DATE, 'Product D', 'Electronics', 2200, 3),
  ('2024-01-04'::DATE, 'Product A', 'Electronics', 1100, 6),
  ('2024-01-04'::DATE, 'Product C', 'Books', 450, 18),
  ('2024-01-05'::DATE, 'Product B', 'Clothing', 1200, 10),
  ('2024-01-05'::DATE, 'Product D', 'Electronics', 1800, 4)
AS t(date, product, category, revenue, quantity);
```

## Sales Overview

Let's look at our sales data:

```sql id="sales_overview"
SELECT
  date,
  product,
  category,
  revenue,
  quantity
FROM sales
WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', date) = '{{report_year}}'
ORDER BY date, product;
```

<DataTable queryId="sales_overview" title="Sales Overview" maxRows={15} />

## Revenue by Category

Now let's analyze revenue by category:

```sql id="revenue_by_category"
SELECT
  category,
  SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
  SUM(quantity) as total_quantity,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  ROUND(AVG(revenue), 2) as avg_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

<DataTable queryId="revenue_by_category" title="Revenue by Category" />

<DataChart
  queryId="revenue_by_category"
  type="bar"
  xField="category"
  yField="total_revenue"
  title="Total Revenue by Category"
  height={350}
/>

## Daily Sales Trends

Let's examine daily sales trends:

```sql id="daily_sales"
SELECT
  date,
  SUM(revenue) as daily_revenue,
  SUM(quantity) as daily_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;
```

<DataChart
  queryId="daily_sales"
  type="line"
  xField="date"
  yField="daily_revenue"
  title="Daily Revenue Trend"
  height={300}
/>

## Product Performance

Finally, let's see which products are performing best:

```sql id="product_performance"
SELECT
  product,
  SUM(revenue * quantity) as total_value,
  SUM(quantity) as total_sold,
  COUNT(*) as sales_count,
  ROUND(AVG(revenue), 2) as avg_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_value DESC;
```

<DataTable queryId="product_performance" title="Product Performance Analysis" />

<DataChart
  queryId="product_performance"
  type="bar"
  xField="product"
  yField="total_value"
  title="Total Value by Product"
  height={350}
/>

## Summary

This dashboard shows how MDX can seamlessly integrate with SQL queries and data visualizations:

- **SQL Execution**: Each ```sql code block is executed automatically
- **Query Results**: Results are stored and can be referenced by visualization components
- **Interactive Components**: Tables and charts update dynamically based on query results
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for both SQL execution and rendering

The system supports complex analytical workflows while maintaining clean, readable documentation.
